#  Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis & Descriptive Statistics

##  Project Overview
This task focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I applied advanced statistical techniques and visualizations using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to uncover underlying patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize the main characteristics of a complex dataset. The goal was to ensure data quality and build a robust foundation for subsequent modeling. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the backbone of any Data Science project. In this task, I performed a rigorous statistical examination of a dataset (such as Iris or Titanic) to understand its underlying structure.

##  Statistical Operations
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Generated a complete summary of the data, including Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, and Variance using the `describe()` method.
- **Data Integrity Check**: 
  - Used `isnull().sum()` to detect missing values within the dataset.
  - Performed label distribution checks to ensure the data is balanced.
- **Advanced Exploratory Analysis**:
  - **Pairplots**: To visualize the pairwise relationships between all features.
  - **Outlier Detection**: Using Boxplots to ensure data quality for future Machine Learning models.
  - **Feature Correlation**: Using Heatmaps to understand which variables have the strongest impact.

##  Technical Implementation
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas.
- **Libraries**: `Seaborn` for high-level statistical graphics.
- **Methods**: `mean()`, `std()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `describe().

##  Conclusion
This EDA process confirmed the dataset's readiness for further modeling by ensuring all data cleaning and basic statistical assumptions were met.
