# Apexcify Technologys Data Science Internship Portfolio

[cite_start]Welcome to my professional repository showcasing the projects completed during my **Data Science & Analysis Internship** at **Apexcify Technologys**[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This program focused on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills by interpreting real-world data[cite: 5, 6].

## About Apexcify Technologys
[cite_start]**Apexcify Technologys** is a leading software development company that values compelling visuals and user-centric design[cite: 4]. [cite_start]Through this internship, I gained hands-on experience with tools and techniques used to make data-driven decisions[cite: 6].

## Internship Objectives
- [cite_start]Mastery of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and Descriptive Statistics[cite: 56].
- [cite_start]Implementation of **Data Visualization** trends and business insights[cite: 35].
- [cite_start]Calculation of key performance metrics like averages and growth[cite: 27].
- Developing clean, documented, and reproducible Python code.
